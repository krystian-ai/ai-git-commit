Here's a sample `openai_api.py` file containing functions for interacting with the OpenAI API:

python

```python
import openai
import os

OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

if not OPENAI_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.")

openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

def generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=50, temperature=0.7, n=1):
    """
    Generate text using OpenAI's GPT model.

    :param prompt: The text prompt to be completed by the model.
    :param max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
    :param temperature: Controls the creativity of the model's output. Higher values result in more random outputs.
    :param n: The number of independent completions to generate for the prompt.
    :return: A list of generated text completions.
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        n=n,
        temperature=temperature,
    )

    return [choice.text.strip() for choice in response.choices]

def generate_commit_message(git_diff):
    """
    Generate a commit message based on the given Git diff.

    :param git_diff: A string representing the Git diff.
    :return: A generated commit message.
    """
    prompt = f"Based on the following Git diff, generate a commit message:\n\n{git_diff}\n\nCommit message:"
    commit_messages = generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=30, temperature=0.5, n=1)
    return commit_messages[0]
```

This file imports the `openai` library, sets up the API key from the environment variable, and defines two functions:

1.  `generate_text()`: A generic function to generate text using the OpenAI API, which can be customized with parameters such as the maximum number of tokens, the creativity level (temperature), and the number of independent completions.
2.  `generate_commit_message()`: A function that takes a Git diff as input and generates a commit message using the `generate_text()` function with a tailored prompt.

1 / 1

Here's a sample `utils.py` file containing utility functions, such as reading Git diffs and handling user input:

python

```python
import subprocess

def get_git_diff():
    """
    Get the Git diff for the current repository.

    :return: A string containing the Git diff.
    """
    result = subprocess.run(["git", "diff"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

def get_user_input(prompt):
    """
    Get user input with the given prompt.

    :param prompt: The prompt to display to the user.
    :return: The user's input as a string.
    """
    return input(prompt)

def get_user_confirmation(prompt):
    """
    Get user confirmation (yes/no) with the given prompt.

    :param prompt: The prompt to display to the user.
    :return: True if the user confirms, False otherwise.
    """
    while True:
        response = input(prompt).lower()
        if response in ["y", "yes"]:
            return True
        elif response in ["n", "no"]:
            return False
        else:
            print("Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")
```

This file contains three utility functions:

1.  `get_git_diff()`: A function that retrieves the Git diff for the current repository by running a Git command using the `subprocess` module.
2.  `get_user_input()`: A simple wrapper around the `input()` function to get user input with a given prompt.
3.  `get_user_confirmation()`: A function that gets a yes or no confirmation from the user using the given prompt. It keeps asking until a valid response is provided.

> main.py:

1 / 1

Here's a sample `main.py` file containing the main logic for interacting with Git and the OpenAI API:

python

```python
import os
import subprocess
from openai_api import generate_commit_message
from utils import get_git_diff, get_user_input, get_user_confirmation

def main():
    git_diff = get_git_diff()

    if not git_diff:
        print("No changes detected. Exiting...")
        return

    commit_message = generate_commit_message(git_diff)
    print(f"Suggested commit message: {commit_message}")

    while True:
        user_response = get_user_confirmation("Accept this commit message? (yes/no/edit): ")

        if user_response is True:
            break
        elif user_response is False:
            commit_message = get_user_input("Enter your commit message: ")
            break
        elif user_response.lower() == "edit":
            commit_message = get_user_input("Edit the commit message: ")
            break

    subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-m", commit_message])
    print(f"Commit successful with message: {commit_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This file contains the `main()` function, which executes the following steps:

1.  Retrieve the Git diff for the current repository.
2.  If there are no changes detected, exit the program.
3.  Generate a commit message using the OpenAI API.
4.  Ask the user if they want to accept, reject, or edit the commit message.
5.  If the user accepts or edits the commit message, proceed with the Git commit. If the user rejects, prompt them to enter their own commit message.
6.  Execute the Git commit with the provided commit message.

The `main()` function is called at the end of the script when the file is run as a standalone program.

1 / 1

Here's a sample `install.sh` shell script for installing the required dependencies and setting up the environment:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Python is installed and the version is 3.6 or higher
if ! command -v python3 &>/dev/null || ! python3 -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3, 6)" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Python 3.6 or higher is required. Please install or update Python."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if pip is installed
if ! command -v pip3 &>/dev/null; then
    echo "pip3 is required. Please install pip3."
    exit 1
fi

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Create an alias or symlink for the ai-git-commit command
if [[ "$SHELL" == *"bash"* ]]; then
    echo "alias ai-git-commit='python3 $(pwd)/ai_git_commit/main.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
elif [[ "$SHELL" == *"zsh"* ]]; then
    echo "alias ai-git-commit='python3 $(pwd)/ai_git_commit/main.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
else
    echo "Unsupported shell. Please manually create an alias or symlink for ai-git-commit."
fi

echo "Installation complete. Make sure to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable."
```

This shell script:

1.  Checks if Python 3.6 or higher and pip3 are installed. If not, it exits with an error message.
2.  Installs the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3.  Creates an alias or symlink for the `ai-git-commit` command depending on the user's shell (bash or zsh). If the shell is unsupported, the user is prompted to manually create an alias or symlink.
4.  Informs the user to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

Remember to make the script executable by running `chmod +x install.sh` before executing it.

> 1 / 1
> 
> requirements.txt

1 / 1

Here's a sample `requirements.txt` file listing the required Python packages for the AI-Git-Commit project:

shell

```shell
openai>=0.27.0
```

In this project, the only required package is `openai`, which provides the Python interface for the OpenAI API. The `requirements.txt` file specifies a minimum version of `0.27.0`, but you can adjust this according to your needs or update it as new versions are released. The `install.sh` script will use this file to install the necessary packages via `pip3`.

Here's an updated version of `main.py` that should work on Windows, Linux, and MacOS:

python

```python
import os
import sys
import subprocess
from openai_api import generate_commit_message
from utils import get_git_diff, get_user_input, get_user_confirmation

def main():
    git_diff = get_git_diff()

    if not git_diff:
        print("No changes detected. Exiting...")
        return

    commit_message = generate_commit_message(git_diff)
    print(f"Suggested commit message: {commit_message}")

    while True:
        user_response = get_user_confirmation("Accept this commit message? (yes/no/edit): ")

        if user_response is True:
            break
        elif user_response is False:
            commit_message = get_user_input("Enter your commit message: ")
            break
        elif user_response.lower() == "edit":
            commit_message = get_user_input("Edit the commit message: ")
            break

    git_command = ["git", "commit", "-m", commit_message]

    if sys.platform == "win32":
        # On Windows, use shell=True for subprocess.run()
        subprocess.run(git_command, shell=True, text=True)
    else:
        subprocess.run(git_command, text=True)

    print(f"Commit successful with message: {commit_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The primary change in this version is that the `subprocess.run()` function now checks for the platform using `sys.platform` to determine if it should use `shell=True` when running on Windows.

> install.sh:

1 / 1

Since `install.sh` is a shell script, it is not directly compatible with Windows. Instead, you can create a separate `install.bat` script for Windows installation. For Linux and MacOS, you can use the provided `install.sh` script as is. Here's the `install.bat` script for Windows:

batch

```batch
@echo off

rem Check if Python is installed and the version is 3.6 or higher
where python >nul 2>nul || (
    echo Python 3.6 or higher is required. Please install or update Python.
    exit /b 1
)

python -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3, 6)" >nul 2>nul || (
    echo Python 3.6 or higher is required. Please install or update Python.
    exit /b 1
)

rem Check if pip is installed
where pip >nul 2>nul || (
    echo pip is required. Please install pip.
    exit /b 1
)

rem Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

rem Create an alias or symlink for the ai-git-commit command
echo @echo off > ai-git-commit.bat
echo python "%cd%\main.py" %%* >> ai-git-commit.bat
move ai-git-commit.bat %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps /Y >nul

echo Installation complete. Make sure to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
```

To use the `install.bat` script on Windows, right-click the file and select "Run as administrator." This script performs the following steps:

1.  Check if Python 3.6 or higher and pip are installed. If not, exit with an error message.
2.  Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3.  Create a batch file named `ai-git-commit.bat` that runs the `main.py` script with the provided command-line arguments.
4.  Move the `ai-git-commit.bat` file to the `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps` folder, which should be included in the system's `PATH` variable by default.
5.  Inform the user to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

Now the project should be compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Remember to include both `install.sh` and `install.bat` scripts in the project's root folder.
